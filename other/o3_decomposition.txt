Below is the thinking-plan I’d follow before writing a single line of code.  
It’s based on what has kept real-world parsers running safely in production long after the original author moved on.

## 1. First questions to settle

| Question | Why it matters | My decision |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Exact contract of “parse”** | Determines error-handling and performance constraints. | _Pure function_ → `str → Block`, never crashes, returns an error object on failure. |
| **Streaming vs. load-all-at-once** | Large docs, back-pressure, memory. | Stream **line-by-line**; materialise sub-trees lazily, but we don’t need true streaming JSON output. |
| **Strictness level** | How forgiving the parser is. | Fail fast on *structural* errors (unbalanced tags, bad list prefix), ignore superficial issues (extra blank lines). |
| **Extensibility** | Future tags, new list kinds. | Table-driven tag registry + strategy pattern so new constructs plug in without touching the core automaton. |

---

## 2. High-level architecture

```
               +------------------+
input text --> |  Line Scanner    |  yields Token(stream)
               +------------------+
                            |
                            v
                  +------------------+
                  |  Parser (LL)     |  builds AST
                  +------------------+
                            |
                            v
                +----------------------+
                |  Validator/Normalizer|  enforces spec,
                |  fixes trivial issues|
                +----------------------+
                            |
                            v
                  +------------------+
                  |  JSON Encoder    |
                  +------------------+
```

### Why a two-phase **scan + parse**?

* Keeps the grammar understandable.  
* Errors surface with accurate line/col.  
* The spec’s constructs (`<block>`, `<dict>`, `<list kind=".">`) are already token-like tags.

---

## 3. Token design

| Token | Example | Payload |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `TagOpen` | `<dict sep=":">` | name=`dict`, attrs |
| `TagClose` | `</dict>` | name |
| `Line` | `First paragraph.` | raw text |
| `Blank` |  |  |

Scanner = regex on per-line basis → O(N) and trivial to debug.

---

## 4. Parser strategy

* **Recursive-descent** (hand-written), not a generator framework.  
  * Grammar is simple, recursion depth low, hand code is clearer and faster to optimise than a generic PEG for this case.
* Maintain a **stack** of container nodes (`Block`, `ListBlock`, `Dictionary`) mirroring the tag nesting.
* List parsing:
  * Detect prefix (`1.`, `2.1.`, `•`, `o`) with regex.
  * When prefix changes, decide whether it is:  
    1. **same level** → new sibling,  
    2. **child** → push new list onto stack,  
    3. **higher level** → pop until it matches.
* Dictionary parsing:
  * Separator supplied by attribute; default `:`.
  * Split once on first occurrence to keep values intact.
* Text outside any explicit tag always belongs to the body of *current* block.

---

## 5. Data model & validation

* Use the **exact Pydantic schemas** from the spec.  
  * Gains runtime type checks + JSON serialization “for free”.  
  * Declarative constraints (e.g., `kind="block"`) catch errors early.
* After AST is built, run a **validator pass**:
  * Ensure list items are homogeneous.
  * Ensure no unexpected tokens remain.
  * Collapse consecutive strings into single string if desired.

---

## 6. Error handling philosophy

* Parser never throws; collects `ParseError` objects with:  
  * severity (`fatal`, `warning`)  
  * message  
  * line/col span
* On the first fatal error → abort building AST, return partial tree + errors.

This keeps the consumer (e.g., an AI pipeline) from crashing yet surfaces useful diagnostics.

---

## 7. Testing strategy

1. **Golden tests** – the spec already provides a perfect suite; round-trip each example.
2. **Property-based tests** with Hypothesis:  
   * Randomly delete/duplicate tags, ensure we fail gracefully.  
   * Generate arbitrary key/value pairs to hammer dictionaries.
3. **Fuzzers** for large random documents to find stack overflows or exponential blow-ups.
4. Performance benchmarks:  
   * 10 MB file should parse < 200 ms on commodity laptop.  
   * Memory peak < 2× file size.

---

## 8. Performance & robustness tricks

| Issue | Mitigation |
|-------|------------|
| Deep recursion risk | Iterative stack, tail recursion elimination. |
| Large dict or list | Pre-allocate lists using `.reserve()` semantics (if language allows). |
| Regex backtracking | Compile once, use anchored patterns, avoid `.*?` where not needed. |
| I/O bottlenecks | Buffered reader; streaming decoder for UTF-8. |

---

## 9. Deployment & maintenance

* Package core as a **pure library** (no CLI/runtime deps) plus a thin CLI wrapper.
* Expose **`parse(text) -> (Block, List[ParseError])`**; anything else is convenience.
* Semantic versioning; failing examples added to test corpus before every release.
* Provide a **small playground** (Web/Python notebook) so non-engineers can paste text and see JSON—reduces support tickets.
* Logging behind a feature flag to avoid perf hit in production.

---

## 10. Future-proofing & nice-to-haves

1. **Incremental parsing** – if documents come from an editor, re-parse only changed chunks.  
2. **Schema evolution** – keep tag registry string-based; unknown tags become `UnknownBlock` but keep payload so older parsers degrade gracefully.  
3. **Bidirectional conversion** – pretty-print JSON back to text, useful for diffing.  
4. **Pluggable renderers** – HTML, Markdown, etc., built atop the same AST.

---

### The takeaway

*Keep the algorithm simple, the layers thin, and the contracts explicit.*  
A deterministic hand-written recursive-descent parser with a modest scanner gets us:

* **Speed** – linear time, small constants.  
* **Reliability** – no hidden magic, straightforward to debug.  
* **Maintainability** – new syntactic features are usually one extra case in the token stream or one new node type, nothing more.

That combination is what has kept the parsers I wrote a decade ago still running happily in production today.
